## Hi I'm Cesare 😄 👋
### A React Developer 👨🏻‍💻

I'm a React developer who loves building project. I put some projects that show what I have learned and some of my skills: 
Html, Css, JavaScript, React, React Native, Redux, Tailwind Css, Styled Components ...

I'm learning Typescript, React Native and Next.js to keep learning new skills and be a better developer.
