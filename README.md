## Hi I'm Cesare ðŸ˜„ ðŸ‘‹
### A React Developer ðŸ’»

I'm a React developer who loves building project. I put some projects that show what I have learned and some of my skills: 
Html, Css, JavaScript, React, React Native, Redux, Tailwind Css, Styled Components ...
I'm curious and learning React Native and Next.js to keep learning new skills and be a better developer.
